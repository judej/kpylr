Simple Compiler written in Python

## Origin

Working through the awesome tutorial videos (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaFP8iQMTuPXinXBMEXsSuw) that Immo Landwerth has for compiler writing. While his code is in C#, this one is in Python. Architecturally the same. Using Python builtins to keep it simple

## Contributing

Feel free. There is plenty of opportunities to make the code more pythonic and more readable.

#### Special thanks for Immo
